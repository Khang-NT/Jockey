Jockey 0.3_a-m0r0 Release Notes
 - Test post please ignore
 - Did some stuff
 - Added some things
 - It's pretty cool, I guess.
 - I could have just hardcoded this in, but that's not as fun
 - Seriously, though, I just want to see if AlertDialogs can have scroll bars
 - They probably can, but if they can't then I probably have to do something weird to make it work
 - These are some really long release notes
 - Also, sorry if you saw the 0.3 APK and got excited. That was also a test post.
 - Don't worry though, 0.3 is coming soon... ish.... Probably.
