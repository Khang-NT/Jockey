## Notice About Versions Prior to 0.3
Starting with version 0.3, Jockey's downloads have been hosted on GitHub instead of SourceForge. Earlier versions of Jockey will attempt to download the latest version from SourceForge (which only prompts to update from the latest version from GitHub). Additionally, Jockey's package signature is different in versions older than 0.3 meaning that **one has to uninstall older versions of Jockey before upgrading to 0.3+**.

**For seamless updates, you shouldn't install a version older than 0.3**
