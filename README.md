# Jockey Demo
This branch contains a version of Jockey that has been modified to create promotional material including screenshots, videos, etc. Its most important difference between the release version is that **it does not scan your device's music library**. Instead, it looks for a premade music library in its external storage directory.

This is intended for internal use, and most people should not use this branch at all. [Click here if you're looking for the regular version of Jockey](https://github.com/marverenic/Jockey).

## Sample library
A sample library is available in the sample-library directory in the root directory of this branch. To use it, place its contents in Jockey's external storage directory (typically /sdcard/Android/data/com.marverenic.music.demo/files/). Library files are in JSON format.
