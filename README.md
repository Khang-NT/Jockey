# Get Jockey
This branch contains compiled APK's for Jockey. You can install Jockey like any other app that isn't in the Play Store (Also referred to as sideloading) -- just enable installation of applications from "Unknown Sources" in settings, open the APK on your phone like a regular file and follow the instructions of the package installer.

## Google Play
The easiest way to get Jockey is from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marverenic.music). You can still sideload the latest version yourself by using one of the links below, but you'll have to update Jockey manually every time an update is released.

### Beta testing
Beta versions of Jockey are also available on Google Play. You can opt-in to beta testing [here](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.marverenic.music), but keep in mind that things can break from time to time.

## Notice About Versions Prior to 0.3
Starting with version 0.3, Jockey's downloads have been hosted on GitHub instead of SourceForge. Earlier versions of Jockey will attempt to download the latest version from SourceForge (which only prompts to update from the latest version from GitHub). Additionally, Jockey's package signature is different in versions older than 0.3 meaning that **one has to uninstall older versions of Jockey before upgrading to 0.3+**.

**For seamless updates, you shouldn't install a version older than 0.3**
